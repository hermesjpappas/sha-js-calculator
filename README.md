# JavaScript Calculator
<img src="images/calc.png"/>

## Welcome to the calculator of your dreams!
<p>Sort of.</p>

<p>This is an exercise from Social Hackers Academy where I first brought HTML, CSS and JS together. I also learned some interesting things about the power of regular expressions through this. Overall, quite a fun project!</p>

## Instructions:
<p>Click the buttons with your mouse to get your result. Click the sound/note button to get some retro bleeps.</p>

## Issues / TO-DO:
<p>Keyboard input currently not enabled. 
Probably works best for resolutions higher than 1080p.</p>
